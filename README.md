# shortcut.py
A python-based interface for [shortcut-pages](https://github.com/mt-empty/shortcut-pages) on Github.

## Basic Usage
To see the shortcuts for a given program, type:
```bash
shortcuts.py program-name-here
```

## Requirements
This program is written with Python 3.9+ however, versions as early as Python 3.6 are likely to function properly.

## Setup
- Firstly, clone the repository to your computer
- Download the page directories `GUI` and/or `nonGUI` from the [shortcut-pages](https://github.com/mt-empty/shortcut-pages) repo
- Move the individual pages into a directory called `pages` in the shortcuts.py root folder.
An automated process is in the pipeline.

## To do
- Automated initial install setup
- Automated way of updating pages on command
- List all available pages
- Config file for settings (maybe)
- Fix absolute vs relative path issues
