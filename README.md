A python-based interface for shortcut-pages on Github.

# Basic Usage
To see the shortcuts for a given program, type:
`shortcuts.py program-name-here`

# Requirements
This program is written with Python 3.9+ however, versions as early as 3.6 are likely to function properly.

# Setup

An automated process is in the pipeline.
